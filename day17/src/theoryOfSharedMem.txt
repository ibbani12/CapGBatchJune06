shared mem = is a common mem which is shared betn one or more processes.

- it is the faster IPC 

- in applications that exchange large amt of data.

steps:
 1. request for mem seg that can be shared amoung diff process.
 2. associate the part of that mem or even the whole mem with the address space of the calling function.


 shmget() := used to create a mem seg

 int shmget(key_t key, size_t size, int shmflg);

 key=> unique key identifire,
 size=> size of the shared mem seg. : 4096 byte 
 shmflg=> perrmisssion


shmat() := attchs mem seg to the process

void* shmat(int shmid, const void *shmaddr, int shmflg);

shmdt() -> deatch the shared mem from the process

shmctl() ->

shmctl(shmid, IPC_RMID, NULL);


/*

char *f()
{
	char *name  = NULL; => 2000
	name = new char[20];
	strcpy(name,"bhima");
	return name;
}

main()
{
	
	cout<<f()<<endl;

}
